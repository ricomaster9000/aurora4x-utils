# Aurora Autosaver
Just a simple autosaver for Aurora 4x C#

I made this for myself because Aurora 4x C# has no autosave functionality

BEWARE - this takes control of your mouse to quite literally click the save button (it will try to dynamically pinpoint where save button is)

make sure Java 17 JRE is installed to use, just double click on jar file to run

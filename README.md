Dynamic Modular Extendable Universally usable calculator app (SOLID design)

For Java 17+ (will migrate to Java 21 once AWS officially starts supporting Java 21)

A serious personal project of mine to create a powerful universally usable java web app that can perform basic to advanced to cpu-intensive calculations accurrately and nearly on par with C++ C level performance using the Java Foreign Function and Memory API.

For now only basic calculations and the features around the usage of the Foreign Function and Memory API will be implemented.

I intend to use this for one of my other private personal projects.
